Description: A tool for simulating a variety of spatial individual-based models of plant-plant interactions. User-created models can include any number of species, each of which can be structured in any number of life-stages, where each life-stage has specific death, growth and reproduction rates, as well as specific interaction radius, dispersal radius, and interaction effects over each other species/life-stage. Interactions be positive (facilitation) or negative (competition) and can affect death rates, growth rates or reproduction rates. All models work in continuous time and space.
